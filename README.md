# Network-Forensics
Network Forensics Investigation – Analysis of captured network traffic to identify malicious activity, reconstruct sessions, and extract evidence using tools like Wireshark, Security Onion, Hexed.it, Network Minor. Includes methodology, reports and packet analysis.
Overview

This repository documents a network forensics case study focused on analyzing captured packet data to detect suspicious activity, reconstruct user sessions, and extract potential evidence of compromise.

I investigated packet captures (PCAPs), logs, and metadata to uncover artifacts related to malicious activity.

⚠ Note: Raw PCAPs and sensitive log files are not included due to size and confidentiality. Instead, this repo contains analysis notes, scripts, and reports that demonstrate the forensic process.
